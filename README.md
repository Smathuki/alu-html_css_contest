Report on Developing the University Alumni Website
Introduction and Project Overview
This report gives an inside look at building the University Alumni website. We'll talk about how we used CSS and markup, made the site work well on different screens, and end with some suggestions for making it even better.

Our main goal was to make a website where university alumni could get info about events, connect with other alumni, and sign up for events. Here's what we'll cover:

CSS Tricks: How we made the site look nice with CSS.
Writing HTML: How we wrote the stuff on the site.
Sizing for All Screens: How we made it work on phones and computers.
The End: What we learned and what was tough.
What We Could Do Better: Challenges and what we can do next.
References: Where we found helpful info.
CSS Tricks - Making the Site Look Cool
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was our secret sauce for making the Alumni site look great. We did a few things:

Making it Fit: We used tricks with CSS to make sure everything looked good on small phones and big computers.

Fonts and Stuff: We picked nice fonts and made the words look good. We also spaced them out so they're easy to read.

Colors and Themes: We used CSS to pick colors that matched our school's style. This made the site look like it belonged to our university.

Buttons and Menus: We made the buttons, links, and menus look nice so you can easily click on them.

Phone-Friendly: We used special tricks to make sure it looks good on your phone or computer. No squinting required!

We also learned some fancy stuff like CSS classes and IDs, and how to make things change when you hover your mouse over them. All of this made the site pretty and easy to use.

Writing HTML - Putting Words and Pictures on the Site
HTML is the language we used to put everything on the Alumni site. Here's what we did:

Nice Structure: We used headings, paragraphs, and lists in a smart way. This makes it easy for people to find stuff and also helps search engines like Google understand our site.

Forms and More: We made forms for event sign-ups, added dropdowns, and radio buttons for choices.

Links and Menus: We used links to create menus so you can jump to different parts of the site.

Adding Images and Videos: We put in pictures and videos to make things look cool and interesting.

Tables (if needed): If we had to show data in tables, we did it properly.

All this HTML stuff follows the rules and makes our site easy to use and find on the internet.

Sizing for All Screens - Making It Work Everywhere
We didn't want the site to look weird on different devices, so we did these things:

Screen Tweaks with Media Queries: We used special code to make sure the site looks good whether you're on your phone or a big computer.

Flexible Layouts: We made everything flexible so it fits on any screen. No need to scroll forever or squint at tiny text.

Pictures and Videos Fit Too: We made sure images and videos adjust to your screen size so they don't look stretched or tiny.

Start with the Phone: We designed for phones first because most people use them. Then we made it better for computers.

This made sure our site works for everyone, no matter what device they use.

The End - What We Did and What Was Tough
In the end, we made a good Alumni website that looks nice and works well. We learned a lot:

CSS Skills: We got better at using CSS to make things look pretty.

Smart HTML: We learned to use HTML in a way that's good for people and search engines.

Responsive Design: We figured out how to make our site fit all screens.

Challenges and What's Next
But, there were some tough parts:

Browser Battles: Sometimes, our site didn't look the same on different browsers. We had to do extra testing and fixing.

Managing Content: As more alumni join, we might need a better way to manage the website content. A content management system (CMS) could help.

Speed It Up: We could make the site load faster by shrinking images and cleaning up the code.

To make the site even better, we suggest:

Keep Learning: Stay updated with new CSS and HTML tricks through tutorials and courses.

Speed Check: Make the site faster by making images smaller and using content delivery networks (CDNs).

CMS Magic: Look into using a CMS like WordPress or Drupal for easier content management.

Doing these things will make the site even more awesome for alumni.
